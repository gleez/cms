## Overview

**MongoDB** (from "hu**mongo**us") is an open source document-oriented database system developed and supported by
[10gen](http://www.10gen.com/). It is part of the NoSQL family of database systems. Instead of storing data in
tables as is done in a "classical" relational database, [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org) stores structured data
as JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas (MongoDB calls the format BSON), making the integration of data in
certain types of applications easier and faster.
