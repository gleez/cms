 * Abstract controller class
 *
 * Controllers should only be created using a [Request].
 *
 * Controllers methods will be automatically called in the following
 * order by the request:
 * ~~~
 * $controller = new Controller_Foo($request);
 * $controller->before();
 * $controller->action_bar();
 * $controller->after();
 * ~~~
 *
 * The controller action should add the output it creates to
 * `$this->response->body($output)`, typically in the form of a [View], during the
 * "action" part of execution.
