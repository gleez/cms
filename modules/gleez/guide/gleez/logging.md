# Introduction

The __Gleez Log__ component monitors your website, capturing system events in a log to be reviewed by an authorized individual at a later time. The log is simply a list of recorded events containing usage data, performance data, errors, warnings and operational information. It is vital to check the log report on a regular basis as it is often the only way to tell what is going on.

## Supported Log Writers

+ __File__ - Writes out messages and stores them in a YYYY/MM directory
+ __STDERR__ - Writes out messages to STDERR
+ __STDOUT__ - Writes out messages to STDOUT
+ __Syslog__ - Writes out messages to syslog
+ __Mango__ -  Writes out messages to with using [MongoDB DBMS](http://www.mongodb.org)

## Usage

You can specify the log writer at bootstrap time in `/application/bootstrap.php` file:

~~~
// Using file log writer
Kohana::$log->attach(new Log_File(APPPATH.'logs'));

// Using STDERR log writer
Kohana::$log->attach(new Log_StdErr());

// Using STDOUT log writer
Kohana::$log->attach(new Log_StdOut());

// Using Syslog log writer
Kohana::$log->attach(new Log_Syslog());

// Using Gleez Mango Log
Kohana::$log->attach(new Log_Mango());
~~~

Multiple writers are supported.

## Mango Log Writer

Mango Log Writer uses __Gleez Mango__ component. In its turn __Gleez Mango__ uses configuration groups to create MongoDB instances.

The default configuration group is loaded based on the `Mango::$default` setting.
It is set to the `default` group as standard, however this can be changed within the `/application/bootstrap.php` file:

~~~
// Change the default config group
Mango::$default = 'mygroup';

// Using Gleez Mango Log
Kohana::$log->attach(new Log_Mango());
~~~
