## Gleez CMS uses Kohana 3.2 as its foundational framework!

[Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org/) 3 is an HMVC ([Hierarchical Model View Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMVC)) framework written on [PHP](http://php.net) that lets developers create web applications easier and faster. Perhaps you've heard of the MVC architectural pattern. Frameworks like [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), [CodeIgniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter), [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/), and many others use MVC. [Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org/) 3 is a little different because it is using the HMVC pattern. HMVC is deemed as the "logical" evolution of MVC. HMVC can be quickly described as an MVC that can have children MVC's.


## What is Gleez then?

[Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org/) 3 is a lean and mean framework, it does nothing else but to provide developers with libraries and simple, non-restrictive patterns that make building web applications faster and easier than many other frameworks. Gleez is simply a module for [Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org/) 3. It mainly provides the user interfaces(GUI) and libraries, and some additional conventions to easily manage a website system.
