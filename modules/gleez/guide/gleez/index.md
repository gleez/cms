#Gleez CMS 

Gleez is an open source, [extensible Content Management System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) that is built on the [Kohana Framework](http://kohanaframework.org). Gleez is the fusion of many good concepts from the 3 most popular CMS: Joomla, Drupal, Wordpress and Ruby Rails. With years of experience using these, we've gathered great ideas and in some cases, improved on them.

But creating this CMS quickly would have been nearly impossible without its foundational framework - Kohana 3.

###Easy to Use, Easy to Extend


* **Web Bloggers, Admins and Publishers** will love it because it's very easy to use like WordPress and Joomla.

* **Site Builders** will love it because it's modular, many aspects are inspired by Drupal.

* **Developers** will love it because it's just Kohana 3.x with a CMS module.

* **Designers** will love it because its theming system is just simple HTML and PHP just like Joomla's.
