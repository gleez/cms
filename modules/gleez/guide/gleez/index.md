# Gleez CMS

Gleez is an open source, [extensible Content Management System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) that is built on the [Kohana Framework](http://kohanaframework.org). Gleez is the fusion of many good concepts from the 4 most popular CMS: Joomla, Drupal, Wordpress and Ruby Rails. With years of experience using these, we've gathered great ideas and in some cases, improved on them.

[!!] Gleez CMS is licensed under a [Gleez CMS License](http://gleezcms.org/license), so you can legally use it for any kind of open source, commercial, or personal project.

But creating this CMS quickly would have been nearly impossible without its foundational framework - Kohana 3.

## Easy to Use, Easy to Extend

+ **Web Bloggers, Admins and Publishers** will love it because it's very easy to use like WordPress and Joomla.
+ **Site Builders** will love it because it's modular, many aspects are inspired by Drupal.
+ **Developers** will love it because it's just Kohana 3.x with a CMS module.
+ **Designers** will love it because its theming system is just simple HTML and PHP just like Joomla's.
